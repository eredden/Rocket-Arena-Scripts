# ROBLOX Rocket Arena Scripts

### Overview

The scripts included within this repository are original scripts that I created for the ROBLOX game [Rocket Arena](https://www.roblox.com/games/12579566572/Rocket-Arena#!/about), where you can battle players with rockets, swords, and brick walls in a more detailed version of the original 2008 map with added features like trampolines at the bottom of map and gamemodes.

### Purpose

This repository is intended to be a display of my work and is not necessarily meant for reuse, as the scripts are generally specific to the things I needed to do within my game. With that being said, you are free to reuse them so long as you do not fully claim them to be yours.
