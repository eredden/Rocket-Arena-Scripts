# ROBLOX Rocket Arena Scripts

### Overview

The scripts included within this repository are original scripts that I created for the ROBLOX game [Rocket Arena](https://www.roblox.com/games/12579566572/Rocket-Arena#!/about), where you can battle players with rockets, swords, and brick walls in a more detailed version of the original 2008 map with added features like trampolines at the bottom of map and gamemodes.

I have gone ahead and made the game available to copy as well, so if you would like to see the scripts in their original form as they are used in the game then you can make a copy of it on ROBLOX.

### Purpose

This repository is intended to be a display of my work and is not necessarily meant for reuse, as the scripts are generally specific to the things I needed to do within my game. With that being said, you are free to reuse them so long as you do not fully claim them to be yours.
